# CINE.AR_Web-scraping
You can use this script to scrap movies from the website CINE.AR by adding a .env file to your local folder (where the script is located) and then add two keys: EMAIL and PASSKEY. The format should be as any '.env' file: 

  **key = value**

Then, you are ready to run the script:

  - By terminal: located on the folder where the script is, run **'py webScrapping.py'**.

An HTML file will be generated, named **'peliculas.html'**. You open that in a browser, and then you have all the cards showing the movies in the site.
